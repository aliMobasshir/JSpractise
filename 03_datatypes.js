//data types are of 2 types (i) primitive (ii) non-primitive

let age = 21
let name = "Mobasshir"
let isLoggedIn = true

//in js there's is no need to specify the type of data as it automatically detects it

//primitive datatypes in js include
//number => 2 to power 53
//bigint => large integer values
//string => "assembly of characters"
//boolean => true or false
//null => stand alone value (type object)
//undefined => any undefied value
//symbol => to specify uniqueness
//object => (will be further discussed)

//non-primitive  datatypes includes => arrays ,objects , functions

console.log(typeof age) //use to find the datatype of a value  or
console.log(typeof (age)) //use to find the datatype of a value
